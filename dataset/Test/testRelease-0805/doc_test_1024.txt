From Diamond Care Manager Note by Dori Greene, RN, 0-0000, Diamond Care Manager dated 8/23/11.
States on her father's side, there is untreated depression.   And her mother (due to living with her father) by situation has depression and is on sertraline, and is also recovering from shingles.
Her sister is on bupropion and buspirone for her mood and anxiety and it is effective.  Michael wanted to be on bupropion, but at this time Dr Liam put her on another SSRI.  Her team may augment with bupropion in the future if she is still lethargic.
No suicides in her family of origin, no alcoholism.  She has no guns in her home.
