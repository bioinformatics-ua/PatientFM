Family history information was obtained from the patient this morning.  Details from the family history are on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.  Pertinent information is as follows:
Mrs. Benjamin reports that she was born with a congenital case of bilateral foot and hip abnormalities.  Specifically, she states that her toes were bent forward pressing nearly to her shins.  Her hips were also somewhat "constricted".  She required casting of her feet which were altered on a regular basis, and braces on her hips.  Following six months of treatment, braces and casts were removed and the patient reported no additional problems with ambulation.  She states she wore stiff shoes as a child; however, she has had no other orthopedic problems in her remaining childhood or adult life.  She has no children.
Mrs. Benjamin has two brothers, currently ages 39 and 30, and two nephews and three nieces, all of whom are in good general health.  Her parents are also alive and well at 62 and 66.
Mrs. Benjamin's husband is currently 38 years old and reportedly had testicular cancer at age 28.  Following treatment, he has had no recurrence of this cancer.
Mr. Benjamin had one brother who reportedly died at age 19 due to a car accident.  He has two additional living brothers, currently ages 62 an 56, and one sister, age 60, who are in good health.
Mr. Benjamin's sister has one adult son who reportedly was born with cerebral palsy.  Mrs. Benjamin reports that this condition has not been progressive; however, he walks with canes and has "swinging hips."  Otherwise she states that this man has had normal development and is otherwise a very healthy individual.
The remaining family history information for both Mrs. Benjamin and her husband is essentially non-contributory to the risks for this pregnancy.
Mrs. Benjamin reports that her family is of German ancestry.  She reports that her husband's family is of English ancestry.  There is no known consanguinity between these families.
