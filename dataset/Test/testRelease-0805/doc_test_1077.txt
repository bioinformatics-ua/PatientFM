The family history was obtained in detail from the parents by Ms. Mary Kelly; reviewed with them and dictated by Dr. Virginia Michels.
The paternal grandmother, age 54, is healthy.  There is no information on paternal grandfather but it is believed that he was 25-31 at the time of the father's birth.  Father, age 37, is healthy now but he was born with some type of eyelid defect and had several surgeries by the time he was 0 years old.  He would like us to review his Mayo Clinic chart to provide further information on the nature of his eyelid defect.  On observation today, it was apparent that there were some mild residual deformities of the eyelids although he was otherwise a completely normal appearing man.  He had  no history of polydactyly.  He works as a cardiovascular exercise specialist.  The paternal uncle and half uncle are healthy.  There is one healthy paternal first cousin.
Maternal paternal maternal great great uncle was born with at least one extra finger which had a bone in it.  This man is still living and otherwise healthy.  No further details are available but they may be able to get more information from the maternal paternal great grandmother.
The maternal grandfather, age 53, is healthy.  He is 6 feet 4 inches tall.  The maternal grandmother, age 51, is healthy.  She is 5 feet 6-8 inches tall and the patient's mother resembles her own mother in facial appearance.  The mother, age 20, is 5 feet 10 inches tall and healthy.  Her hands were examined and she has no evidence of rudimentary polydactyly, scar, or extra palmar tri-radius.  She had a small firm tissue tag on the lobe of the left ear that resembled the one present on the patient's helix.  Maternal uncle is healthy as are two maternal first cousins.  Sister, age 4, is healthy and did not have polydactyly.  The parents are considering having one more child.
