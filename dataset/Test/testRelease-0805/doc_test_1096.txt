Oliver lives in Rochester, Minnesota, with her mother, Ms. Lori Kieffer; her 23-year-old sister, Hilary; her 12-year-old sister, MacKenzie; and her 4-month-old half-sister, Zoe.  Oliver also has an 21-year-old brother who left high school and is living with a friend in Texas.
According to Dr. Zoey's note, part of mother's motivation in moving from Detroit Lakes to Rochester is to remove Oliver's sister Joseph from a drug-abusing peer group.  Oliver's father, Mr. Robert Sharp, lives in Emmaville, Minnesota.  Oliver's parents divorced about four years ago.  Oliver's stepfather, Mr. Mike Kieffer, lives in North Dakota.  Oliver reported that her mother and Mr. Abigail are separated but are not planning to divorce.
Ms. Abigail reported that she may begin operating a day care center in her home once the family settles in - or look for a position as a preschool teacher.  According to Rachel, her mother has a degree in child development.
Oliver's younger sister has a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and mother believes that Oliver's father has bipolar disorder.  Apparently, mother had Mr. Asher hospitalized against his will during a manic episode, but he left the hospital when the three-day hold expired and refused treatment.  Subsequently, he had only supervised visitation with his children for the next 18 months.  Ms. Abigail reported that Oliver is quite angry about that, and Oliver later verified this.  Oliver stated that the maternal grandparents are extremely religious, and she described what sounds like a possible thought disorder in the maternal grandfather.
