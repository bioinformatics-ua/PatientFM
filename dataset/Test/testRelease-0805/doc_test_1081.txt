A detailed family history was taken during the visit today.  The following are pertinent details from the collection of the complete family history on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.
Lucas has a healthy half brother, age 31, who has two healthy children.  She also had a maternal half sister who was reported to have died shortly after birth.  Lucas described that the baby's brain was not fully developed and she indicated that her mother told her that there was some type of chromosome problem where the baby was missing some genetic material.  Lucas did not have any more specific information at the time of our consult, but she called back later in the day to tell me that her mother reported that this baby had anencephaly and actually did not have a chromosome problem.
Lucas's mother, age 66, has diabetes.  Her father, age 45, is healthy.  Lucas had a maternal aunt who died in her 26s or 36s due to diabetes related complications.  This aunt has two healthy children.
Lucas's husband is 17 and healthy.  He is an only child, but he was told that before his mother had him she was told that she may never be able to have children, and after he was born she had multiple miscarriages.  He stated that they thought that this was due to uterine problems and described that she told him that they "did not remove all of the placenta after he was born" which led to these miscarriages.  His mother, age 37, has high blood pressure.  His father, age 40, has high cholesterol.
There were no reports of mental retardation, learning disabilities or birth defects.  No family members had multiple miscarriages or babies that were stillborn or died early.  There were no reports of cancer before the age of 42.
The remainder of the family history was non-contributory to today's discussion.
The patient reports German and Mexican heritage, and her husband is of German and Norwegian descent. There is no consanguinity reported between these families.
