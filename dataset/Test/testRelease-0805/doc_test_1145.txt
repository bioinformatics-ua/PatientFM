Detailed family history with construction of drawn pedigree is available for viewing in the electronic medical record.
The patient's father is 76 years old.  There is no history of melanoma on his side of the family.
The patient's mother is 68 years old.  After her oldest daughter was diagnosed with malignant melanoma some years ago, she has been getting yearly screens.  In her early 53s she was found to have a lesion on her shoulder that was called pre-melanoma.  A brother of the mother also had a melanoma found on his skin in his mid 68s.  He is now 67 years old.
The patient's oldest sister died at age 27 of metastatic melanoma.  Mrs. Oliver reports that the sister had a lesion removed from her leg at age 23, and a few years later another lesion developed at the scar site.  This turned out to be an invasive melanoma.  This diagnosis was made at age 27.  She died 4-5 years later.
The patient has another sister who is 36 years old, who also gets regular skin checks.  This sister had atypical nevi found at age 38.
The patient has a 7-month-old son who has a chromosome microdeletion that results in him having Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.  I happen to have consulted on this infant, and am continuing to following him.
