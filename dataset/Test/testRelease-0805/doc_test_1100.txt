A detailed family history was taken during the visit today.  The following are pertinent details from the collection of the complete family history on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.
This is Mrs. Liam's second pregnancy, both of which have been with her current husband.  Her first pregnancy resulted in a full term male who is currently healthy at the age of 14 months.  Mrs. Liam has a 32-year-old sister who suffers from irritable syndrome, eczema, and is a carrier for factor V Leiden; she has no children.  Mrs. Liam has a healthy 18-year-old sister who is a carrier for factor V Leiden and has a healthy 1-month-old daughter (her daughter was in the NICU for the first six weeks of life as she was born premature after Mrs. Liam's sister's water broke after bed rest due to preeclampsia).  Mrs. Liam's parents are healthy at the age of 64 (her mother) and 65 (her father).  Mrs. Liam's father has been tested for factor V Leiden and was negative.  Mrs. Liam's mother had a son that died at birth reportedly due to birth complications (decreased oxygen due to delayed C-section).
Mr. Liam is reportedly healthy at the age of 24.  He suffers from acid reflux.  He has a 26-year-old sister who suffers from bulimia and depression; she has no children.
Mr. Liam's mother, approximately 47 years of age, has an elevated blood pressure level.  His father, approximately 51 years of age, has an elevated blood pressure level and was diagnosed with prostate cancer at the age of 51.  Mr. Liam's father had a brother and sister, twins, of whom the brother is still living and healthy at the age of 49.  His sister died at the age of 44 due to cancer metastases after a diagnosis of breast cancer in her late 24's.  She had a daughter who is currently healthy at the age of 22. Mr. Liam's paternal grandmother, age 83, had a myocardial infarction last year and has never been diagnosed with cancer although it is reported that she has other family members who have been diagnosed with breast cancer.
There were no reports of mental retardation, learning disabilities, or birth defects.  No family members had multiple miscarriages.  The remainder of the family history was non-contributory to today's discussion.  The patient reports Caucasian and German (non-Jewish) heritage, and her husband is of Caucasian descent. There is no consanguinity reported between these families.
