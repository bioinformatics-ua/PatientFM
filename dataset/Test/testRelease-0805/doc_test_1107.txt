Three generations of his family history were diagramed with his parents by Ms. Mary Kelly.  The original diagram is on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.  Upon review and amplification, it is remarkable for the following:
Oliver is the only child of either of his parents.
Oliver's father is a healthy 47-year-old gentleman who is aware that he has a right high-frequency hearing loss, which he has attributed to his eight to ten years of service in the Navy flying jet helicopters.  He has no history of ear tag removal at birth or dysmorphic ears, no history of renal problems but has never had a renal ultrasound.  He has passed several Navy physicals without concern.  He has a history of sinusitis and at one point was told that he had only one either ethmoid or maxillary sinus (he cannot remember which).  He has no other unusual body asymmetry and no history of structural congenital heart disease or dextrocardia.  He has no history of situs inversus.  He has no history of bronchiectasis or very frequent recurrent or refractory sinus infections.
Oliver's father's father was deceased age 55 from lung and stomach cancer.  He was a smoker.
Oliver's father's mother, age 68, developed breast cancer age 60.
Oliver's mother is a healthy 40-year-old nurse who was in good health until the development of gestational hypertension with this pregnancy.  Subsequently, her blood pressure has declined on medication.
Oliver's mother's father, age 65, experienced stomach cancer in his 44's.
Oliver's mother's mother, age 65, has type 2 diabetes and hypertension.
Oliver is considered "unique" with regard to his pattern of birth defects within the family.
There is no other family history of birth defects, learning disabilities, developmental delays, mental retardation, seizures.  No history of thrombophilia, and no other history of renal or genitourinary anomalies.
Oliver's parents are not blood relatives.
