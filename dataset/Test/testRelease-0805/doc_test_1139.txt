Patient was referred to a genetic counselor for attainment of a detailed family history and constructions of a drawn pedigree.  Scanned document is available for viewing in the medical record.
The patient's mother is 34 years old and in good health.  For purposes of today's visit, her family history is noncontributory.
Patient's father is 29 years old.  He was diagnosed with malignant hyperthermia after having an episode of rhabdomyolysis at about the age of 17.  He had had numerous surgeries with general anesthesia before this and did not have similar episodes.  These surgeries included a corrective surgery for clubfoot, and inguinal hernia repair as an infant.  He also had several oral surgical procedures to remove baby teeth that would not come out.  He had a series of three such operations in 1988, the last one being three weeks before his episode of rhabdomyolysis.
After the father's diagnosis, the paternal grandmother and a paternal aunt were both tested by contracture testing following muscle biopsy here.  I do not have those records but have taken steps to request them.  Both the paternal grandmother and the paternal great aunt are reported as being positive for susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia.  The father of those two women is also strongly suspected of having susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, based on symptoms.  I do not know the details of those symptoms.
The patient's father has two brothers, age 31 and 29 years old.  The 40 year old had "lock jaw" once during oral surgery.
