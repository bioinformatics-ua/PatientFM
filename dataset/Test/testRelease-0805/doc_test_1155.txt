7/08: The family history was obtained in detail from the mother by Ms. Mary Kelly; reviewed with the mother and dictated and annotated by Dr. Virginia Michels.
The following are pertinent findings from collection of the comprehensive family history.
Maternal grandfather, age 62, had lung cancer.  He had smoked.  Two maternal paternal first cousins once removed had casts on their feet in infancy and one of them also had a metatarsal bar placed but now they have completely normal feet and this never posed long term problems or required surgery.  Three others in that sibship were healthy.  Maternal grandmother died at 40.  She had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and then was found to have a spot in her lung that was an adenocarcinoma.  The primary was never determined.  Mother, age 23, is healthy.  She reports no muscle weakness, symptoms of myasthenia, or droopy eyelids.  No autoimmune disorders and no history of myotonia or cramping.  Maternal aunt, age 38, is healthy.  Maternal uncle died at 6 months of crib death.  He had no musculoskeletal problems prior to that.  Maternal uncle, age 33, is healthy.  Maternal aunt, age 32, is healthy.  Nine maternal first cousins are healthy.  There was one miscarriage.
Paternal grandfather is in his 54's and healthy.  Paternal grandmother is in her 56's and healthy.  Father, age 38, may have mild scoliosis.  Paternal uncle, age 39, might have had mild scoliosis.  Paternal aunt, age 35, is healthy.  Paternal aunt, age 33, has asthma, allergies, and possible eczema or skin sensitivity.  Six maternal first cousins are healthy except one has eczema or sensitive skin.  Maternal half sister, age 2, is healthy.
The parents are not planning additional children at this time, but no permanent precautions have been taken and recurrence risk would not be an issue for them in making a decision about more children.
