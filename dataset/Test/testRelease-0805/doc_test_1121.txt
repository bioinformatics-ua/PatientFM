A detailed family history was not obtained during today's consultation as one is on file in the Department of Medical Genetics (see patient's consultation with medical geneticist Dr. Deandra Pennebaker on November 4, 2005).  Pertinent family history information is as follows:
This is Mrs. Alexander's second pregnancy, both of which have been with her current husband.  Her first conception resulted in a therapeutic induction at approximately 20 weeks of gestation after the fetus was identified to have spina bifida.
Mrs. Alexander is in good health at the age of 32 and reports Polish and Irish (non-Jewish) ancestry.  Mr. Alexander is in good health at the age of 22 and reports English and Polish (non-Jewish) ancestry.
There were no reports of mental retardation or learning disabilities.  No family members had multiple miscarriages or babies that were still born or died early.  There were no reports of cancer before the age of 44. The remainder of the family history was non-contributory to today's discussion.
