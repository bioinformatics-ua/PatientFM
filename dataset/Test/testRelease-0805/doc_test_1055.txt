A four generation family history previously taken from her mother by Ms. Reba Edlin in 2002 and previously reviewed by Dr. Adrien Escamilla is again reviewed and amplified with her mother.  The original diagram is on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.  Upon review and amplification, it is remarkable for the following.
Benjamin has an older sister, now 6-1/2, who is described as having no neurodevelopmental problems, although she is somewhat petite (in contrast to Shahrzad).  She weighed 5 pounds 15 ounces at birth and currently weighs about 48 pounds.  She is said to have had an innocent heart murmur.
Benjamin's father is a 45-year-old physician of mixed Persian and Kurdish descent who stands 5 foot 7 inches tall and has a maximum lifetime weight of 156 pounds.  He has a personal history of lactose intolerance.  He has no history of neurodevelopmental problems or muscle weakness.
His only sister has seven children who are all showing normal growth and development.  He has a maternal half sister in her 34s who is said to have anemia due to thalassemia, and she is the mother of three healthy children.  A half brother in his 23s is also said to be healthy.
Benjamin's mother is a 26-year-old nurse, now homemaker, who stands 5 foot 2 inches tall and has a maximum nonpregnant lifetime weight of 165 pounds.  Towards the end of her second pregnancy (with Shahrzad), she began to develop symptoms and signs of what was ultimately diagnosed and treated as hypothyroidism.  She reports that she tends to get upper respiratory infections easily.  She sleeps a lot.  She does not have migraines, and she does not think she has symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome.  However, she has occasional eye and lip twitches and occasional twitches and "warm spots" in her thighs.  She thinks that her hands are weak (as evidenced by her grip), although her husband disagrees with her.  Interestingly, when she was younger, at 20 years of age, she had a muscle biopsy performed by a Dr. Jacob in California because of a family history of what is described as "core muscle disease."  She is unclear as to the result of that muscle biopsy as it applied to herself.  She was told at one point that she was "okay," but she did not get specific details.  She has never experienced any stroke-like episodes, intermittent episodes of lethargy or vomiting with intercurrent illness, and does not have a personal history of any of the similar body odors described in her daughter.
Benjamin's mother has five paternal half siblings, two boys and three girls.  Two of the girls are described as having eye problems, and in one of them, it is said that she cannot see out of one eye due to "retinal disease."  Benjamin's mother's father himself is a healthy man in his 56s with no similar symptoms.
Benjamin's mother's mother is a 44-year-old woman who was diagnosed on muscle biopsy by Dr. Jacob in California as having "core muscle disease."  She was born with club feet and congenital knee contractures and has had scoliosis.  She has two sisters, both of whom are said, from a muscle biopsy, to have the same "core muscle disease."  One of these sisters is a mother of a child, a male, who died at birth attributed to prematurity.  The second is a woman now the mother of two healthy children.  Another sister is the mother of two boys, one of whom is said to have "angioplastic kidneys."  The other is healthy.  A brother is the father of two children, a male with mental retardation and a daughter with bicuspid mitral valve stenosis and aortic stenosis.
Another of Benjamin's mother's mother's brothers is the father of two girls, one of whom is said to have severe systemic lupus erythematosus, and the other had to have a hysterectomy for cancer.  There are several other sibs of Benjamin's mother's mother who had normal growth and development without problems.
Benjamin's mother's mother's father's brother and Benjamin's mother's mother's mother's sister had six pregnancies together.  One resulted in a first-trimester miscarriage without reported birth defects.  Another resulted in the birth of a man who was deceased at age 44.  He was diagnosed with the same core muscle disease as other family members in childhood and developed ALS in his 40s. Another brother is said to have "rare benign, painful muscle tumors," and he thinks that he is weak.  Another brother is healthy.  Two sisters did not have similar muscle symptoms. One was deceased from a motor vehicle accident in her 35s and was the grandmother of a 24-year-old woman reported to have classical phenylketonuria.  The other was healthy but now has considerable problems as a consequence of being involved in the same motor vehicle accident.
Aside from this, there is no other family history of relevance and in particular none of persons diagnosed otherwise with genetic or metabolic disorders.
Benjamin's parents are not blood relatives.
