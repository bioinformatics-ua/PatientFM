The family history was obtained in detail from the father by Kiley Johnson; reviewed with the father and dictated by Dr. Virginia Michels.
The following are pertinent findings from collection of the comprehensive family history.
Paternal grandfather died with cirrhosis at age 57.  Paternal grandmother died at 67 with stomach and pancreatic cancer.  Father, age 44, is healthy.  He is 6 feet 1 inches tall.  Paternal uncle, age 41, is healthy.  Two female paternal first cousins and two males whose ages range from 17-6 are all healthy.
Maternal grandfather, age 67, smokes but is healthy.  One maternal paternal great uncle has developmental delay.  Six other maternal paternal great uncles and three great aunts are healthy with normal development.  Maternal grandmother, age 58, is healthy.  Ten maternal maternal great aunts and uncles are healthy.  Mother, age 41, is healthy.  She is 5 feet 6 inches tall.  She has some freckles.  Maternal uncle, age 39, is healthy.  Maternal aunt, age 29, is healthy and had an ear tag.  Two female and one male maternal first cousins are healthy.  Brother, age 14, is healthy and somewhat resembles him in facial appearance by a photograph but this was very small.  Next in the sibship was a stillborn.  Brother, age 4, is healthy.  Brother, age 4, has developmental delay and at first was diagnosed with autism but then it was decided that that was not the diagnosis.  He had some regression when the family moved to Rochester when he had just turned 3.  His developmental delays are more severe than Michael's were at this age.  He tends to repeat words, father used the term "echolalia"  but does not speak meaningful words.  His growth is normal at this point.  He has had one episode of bronchitis or pneumonia for which he was hospitalized and treated with medications and the family thinks this may have caused his problems but it did not sound like there was specific evidence for this.  This was their conclusion by exclusion of knowing any other alternative cause.  He has not been evaluated by Dr. Kelly.
