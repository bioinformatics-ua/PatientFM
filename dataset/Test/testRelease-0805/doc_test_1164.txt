Patient was referred to Lucas Elijah for attainment of a detailed family history and construction of a drawn pedigree.  Scanned document is available for viewing in the medical record.  Following are the pertinent findings:
The patient's mother is 20 years old and has dermatomyositis.  She has also been recently found to have thromboses in her brain.  It sounds as though the etiology for this is not entirely clear.  It was discovered shortly after delivery when she developed headaches and visual changes.  There is a partial protein S deficiency, but it is not clear how much of a part that plays.  Both of the maternal grandparents have psoriasis.  A great-great grandmother of Lucas had ovarian cancer, and that woman's daughter had breast cancer at age 81.  There is no other breast cancer on that side of the family.
The patient's father is 25 years old and has asthma.  The paternal family history is otherwise noncontributory.
The patient's parents lost a pregnancy at 24 weeks gestation.  The fetal loss was believed to be due to complications of the mother's autoimmune disease.
