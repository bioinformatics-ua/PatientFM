The family history was obtained in detail from Ms. Elijah by Mary Kelly; reviewed with the patient and dictated by Dr. Jay Ellison.  The following are pertinent findings from collection of the comprehensive family history.
The mother, age 56, has hypertension.  She does not have hearing loss nor asthma.  There are five maternal aunts, and three of these have asthma.  None has any hearing problems.
The maternal grandmother died in her 41s or 43s of complications of asthma.  She had complete bilateral hearing loss that occurred following her sixth pregnancy.  Other details are not known.
The father is in his early 56s and has virtually total hearing loss in his left ear.  His hearing loss was formerly partial in nature, although it is not clear if he was born with some degree of hearing loss in his left ear.  He does not appear to have other medical problems.
The paternal grandfather does not have hearing problems, and there is no information on the paternal grandmother.
Siblings:  The patient has a younger full sister, age 18, who is in good health.  She also has an older maternal half-sister, age 21, who is healthy.  Both sisters have asthma that was especially severe as children.  Neither has hearing loss.  There are no nieces or nephews.
Details of the complete family history are in the Department of Medical Genetics.
