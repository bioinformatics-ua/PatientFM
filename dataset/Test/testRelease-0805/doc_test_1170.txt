A detailed comprehensive family history was obtained from the patient during the visit today.  It was emphasized that our risk assessment is based upon medical and family history information as provided by the patient, and may change in the future should new information be obtained. The complete family history has been saved as a scanned document and is available for viewing. The following are pertinent details.
The patient has a healthy 19-year-old daughter and healthy 10-year-old son.  The patient has one sister who is 54 years of age.  This sister was diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year, although she had had a lump that was irritating her for a few years prior to this.  This sister has refused standard treatment and has not had surgery and instead is completing alternative medicinal therapies.  The patient is not currently in contact with this sister.
The patient's mother died at the age of 61 of diabetes.  She had a benign breast lump removed in her 34s.  She had a hysterectomy in her mid 47s, but the patient is unsure if she had her ovaries removed at that time.  A maternal aunt is approximately 62 years of age and had a breast-related procedure in her 47s.  However, this aunt is unwilling to share information about this procedure with her family members, and thus no additional information is available.  This aunt's daughter is 50 years old and was diagnosed with multifocal DCIS at age 44.  She was treated with a right mastectomy.  Another maternal aunt, age 43 to 58, was diagnosed with atypical ductal hyperplasia in her late 34s.  A third maternal aunt, age 47, was diagnosed with DCIS at age 46.  These last two maternal aunts have had hysterectomies, but the patient is unsure if they also had their ovaries removed.  There are four maternal uncles with no known history of cancer.  There are no other maternal cousins with a history of cancer.  The patient's maternal grandmother died at 83 of diabetes and asthma and had a broken hip.  Her maternal grandfather died at the age of 37 of a heart attack.
There is no information available about the patient's father or other paternal family members.
Mrs. Liam K Noa is of German and other unknown Caucasian ancestry.  There is no history of TAH/BSO or prophylactic mastectomy, except as noted in the scanned pedigree.  There is no known consanguinity or Ashkenazi Jewish heritage.
