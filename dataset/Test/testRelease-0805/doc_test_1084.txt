A detailed family history was taken during the visit today.  The following are pertinent details from the collection of the complete family history on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.
Liam has one healthy daughter, age 4-1/4.  She has a healthy 28-year-old sister who has a healthy son, a healthy daughter, and who is currently pregnant.  Her father is healthy at age 74, and her mother died at age 68 from heart failure that was thought to be caused by liver and kidney failure related to alcoholism.
Liam's husband is 40 and healthy other than having mild Tourette syndrome.  He was adopted and does not know any information about his biological family.
There were no reports of mental retardation, learning disabilities, or birth defects.  No family members had multiple miscarriages or babies that were stillborn or died early.  There were no reports of cancer before the age of 42.
The remainder of the family history was noncontributory to today's discussion.
The patient reports Scottish, English, and German heritage, and although her husband is unaware of his descent, he is Caucasian and appears to be European.  There is no consanguinity reported between these families.
