I obtained the family history in detail from Mrs. Lucas and her husband during their visit today.
The following are pertinent details from the collection of the complete family history on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.
Mrs. Lucas has a 39-year-old brother with type I diabetes.  She has 2 healthy children.  She also has a 33-year-old brother and 18-year-old brother who are both in good general health with no children.  Her father is alive at age 50 with hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Her mother is alive at age 51 with ulcerative colitis.  One of her paternal uncles has a son whose wife had 2 miscarriages as well as a stillborn child.  There was no testing performed to determine the cause of death.  This couple also has 5 healthy children.  Mrs. Lucas has another paternal uncle who has a son with mental retardation of unknown cause.  The family feels it might be velocardiofacial syndrome (VCF).  However, this child does not have a heart defect, no facial clefting or other signs of VCF syndrome.  The remainder of this patient's family history was essentially noncontributory to the risks for this pregnancy.
Mrs. Lucas is accompanied by her husband who is 36 and healthy.   He has one sister, age 21, who is good general health with no children.  His father is alive at age 64 and has multiple sclerosis.  His mother is alive at age 59 with hypertension.  The remainder of his family history is essentially noncontributory to the risks for this pregnancy.
There were no reports of mental retardation, learning disabilities or birth defects in either family.  There were no other reports of multiple miscarriages or babies that died early other than those that were mentioned.  No report of cancer at a young age and the couple denies consanguinity.
Mrs. Lucas is of German, Irish, and European descent.  Her husband is Polish and German.  Due to this couple's European descent, carrier testing for cystic fibrosis was discussed.  Based on the couples ethnic background alone, they have a 1 in 2,500 chance of having a child affected with cystic fibrosis, and carrier testing is available.  Cystic fibrosis is a disease in which thick mucus fills up in the lungs and potentially other organs and can lead to a shortened life span.  Mr. and Mrs. Lucas would both need to be carriers for CF in order to have an affected child.  They decline carrier testing at this time but will be in contact if they change their minds.
