Patient lives with her birth Mom, Dawn, and Mom's partner, Cherish.  She also lives with her 1-year-old brother, Wyatt (Michael).  Her older brother, Jay, age 18, is in foster care, and there are no visits at this time.  Mom angrily commented that his psychologist thought it best if he were not allowed to visit at this time, and Mom and Gabriel report that this is when Noah's behavior worsened (this is the brother that allegedly had abused Abby).
Patient moved to Rochester this winter after having lived in Alabama for three years.  Mom had met Gabriel through a friend and moved she and the children to Alabama.  While living in Alabama, they lived with extended family, including Gabriel's grandparents, two aunts, and one cousin. Mom reports that she and Gabriel have always been open about their relationship with the children and show affection appropriately in front of the children, i.e. "as a heterosexual couple would."
When asked if she still visits her birth father, Liam reported that there is no contact at this time.  Mom reports that she and the children were victims of physical abuse by this man.  Liam had been married to Noah's father and stayed with him "out of fear."  They had lived at one time with his parents and his sister, and Liam reported that when Ian was just 8 years old she noted that he had cigarette burns on his inner thighs and groin area, and Noah's dad had been insistent that his own sister bathe Ian but Mom did do so and noted the burns.  Mom took the children and left and did report to Social Services.  Mom also reported that in that household that there had been abuse of Noah's father's sister and she reported that as well.  Apparently, Noah's father only spent 48 hours in jail and that is the last she knows, i.e., she is unaware of anything that came of Social Service reporting.  There has been no contact since that time. Mom reported that Noah is a product of sexual assault by her ex-husband but stated she wanted and loves Noah dearly.
Patient's grandmother died within the past six months, and her visits with her foster home brother were cancelled which were changes noted by Mom.
