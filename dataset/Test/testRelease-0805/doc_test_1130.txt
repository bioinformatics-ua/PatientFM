A detailed family history was taken during the visit today.  The following are pertinent details from the collection of the complete family history on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.
This is Ms. Alexander's second pregnancy, both of which have been with her current husband.

Ms. Alexander has two healthy brothers (ages 32 and 18) who have no children.  Ms. Alexander's father is healthy at the age of 74.  He had one sibling, a sister, who died before the age of 30 after a diagnosis of breast cancer in her late 19's.  Ms. Alexander's paternal grandfather died in his 64's from lung cancer (he was a heavy smoker).  Ms. Alexander's mother is healthy at the age of 59.  She has only one sibling, Ms. Alexander's maternal uncle, who has never been diagnosed with cancer and is 57 years of age.  Ms. Alexander's maternal grandmother, age 83, was diagnosed with breast cancer in her 53's.  Ms. Alexander's maternal grandmother has two living brothers, three living sisters, and two deceased sisters.  Her first brother is alive and well.  Her second brother was diagnosed with lung cancer.  Her first living sister is in her 86's and her medical history is remarkable for a diagnosis of brain cancer and Alzheimer disease.  Her second living sister, in her 86's, was diagnosed with breast cancer in her 66's.  Her third living sister, in her 78's, was diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 48.

He has a healthy 43-year-old sister who has three healthy sons and has had several miscarriages, for which no reason was given.  Mr. Alexander's mother died at the age of 59 due to cardiac arrest and had a past medical history remarkable for bipolar disorder.  Mr. Alexander's father has had multiple strokes at the age of 68.  Through another partner, Mr. Alexander's father has a healthy 29-year-old son who has no children.  Through another partner, Mr. Alexander's father has a 30-year-old daughter who has no children and suffers from bipolar disorder.
There were no reports of mental retardation, learning disabilities, or birth defects.  No family members had babies that were still born or died early.  The remainder of the family history was non-contributory to today's discussion.
The patient reports Polish (questionably Jewish) heritage, and her husband is of Russian (Ashkenazi Jewish) descent. There is no consanguinity reported between these families.
