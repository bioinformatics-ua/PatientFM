A limited focused family history was obtained from the patient during the visit today.  Our risk assessment is based upon medical and family history information as provided by the patient, and may change should new information be obtained.  The following are pertinent details used for our risk assessment.
The patient's husband reported that his first cousin has a diagnosis of familial dysautonomia. That cousin's son (first cousin-once-removed to the father of the baby) also has a neurological condition that primarily affects speech due to problems with his tongue. It is not clear to us at this time if the younger relative also has familial dysautonomia or some other type of neurological disorder.
There is no other reported family history of mental retardation, birth defects, multiple miscarriages or neonatal death, or other known genetic conditions.
Mrs. Lucas is of German, Swedish, Italian, and French descent. The father of the baby is of Romanian and German descent.  No reported Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry or consanguinity.
