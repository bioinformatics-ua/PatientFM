The family history was obtained in detail from the parents by Mary Kelly; reviewed with the parents and dictated by Dr. Ellison.  The following are pertinent findings from collection of the comprehensive family history.
The patient's father is of German and Russian extraction.  He is 55 years old and in good health.  The paternal grandmother is 82 years old, and she has depression and anxiety.  There are no individuals on that side of the family with developmental delay or other neurodevelopmental problems.
The patient's mother is 46 years old and in good health.  There are several individuals on the maternal side of the family with neurologic, psychiatric or behavioral disorders.  A maternal aunt of the mother is 76 years old and has schizophrenia.  A maternal uncle is now 84 years old and is mentally retarded.  The mother states that this was thought to possibly be associated with a fever during infancy.
The mother has five siblings, none of whom have obvious neurologic or developmental problems.  There are three cousins of Owen on that side of the family who do have problems.  One has been diagnosed with ADHD, and another, who is age of       , seems to have autism.  Another cousin had some unspecified neurologic problems around the ages of 8-13.
Owen has a 17-year-old sister who is healthy.  The mother had three first trimester miscarriages in between the births of her two children.
Details of the complete family history are in the Department of Medical Genetics.
