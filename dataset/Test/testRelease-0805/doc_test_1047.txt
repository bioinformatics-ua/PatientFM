Paternal cousin with ovarian cancer, died at age 55.  This aunt's daughter (the patient's first cousin once removed) apparently underwent BRCA testing and presumably was said to be positive.  This cousin's daughter had bilateral mastectomy and an oophorectomy in her 37s.  Apparently a breast cancer was diagnosed around that time.  Paternal aunt died at 55, reportedly of breast cancer.  Another paternal aunt who had breast cancer diagnosed age 34 and died at 44.
Medical genetics consultation with Dr. Oliver May 18, 2010.  BRCA testing is pending.
The patient's father had six-vessel bypass surgery at age 56.  Maternal aunt died at age 64 of aortic rupture.  Her younger brother, Matthew, has a valve disorder where part of his valve flap is missing.  He is age 33.
At the patient's September 7, 2010, visit, she reports that she did, in fact, have a positive BRCA test.  Her mutation test was positive for BRCA1, described as Q563X (1806C>T).
