Lucas Braun is a 1-year-old who is currently living both with his mother and his father who are divorced.  Lucas spends part of every day with his mom and part of every day with his dad, similar to the routine they had when they were together in a relationship.  Patient's mother reports that Lucas's father, Don, moved to his new home in April and that patient's mother moved to her new home this summer.  Since mother works full-time during the days and dad works at night, Lucas spends his days with his dad and his evenings and nights with his mother.
Lucas is scheduled to begin kindergarten this fall at Sunset Terrace.  While in the room with his mom as she began talking and identifying Lucas's struggles with getting mad, angry, upset when things do not go his way, Lucas responded to his mother's comments by putting his hand over her mouth and continually trying to put his hand over her mouth.  When she would pull his hand and ask him to sit up straight, he would not willing to follow direction.  Lucas's mother, Barb, identifies Lucas as needing tools for real life and different ways to manage his anger given the fact that he has had quite a number of blowups, and it seems to be escalating and getting worse.  Patient's mother was quick to note that these behaviors from Lucas are not new and that he has been quite behaviorally challenging since he was a little boy.
REACTION
Patient's mother was open and thoughtful in discussing things and clear about not saying too much that would have been hard on Logan.  She was quick to point out some of his strengths and what a joy he can be to be around when invited to enumerate some of his strengths.  Lucas clearly had a difficult time having his mother talk in the room, and at that point, I invited his mother to leave the room so we could spend some one-on-one time.  I wanted to give Lucas an opportunity to talk since he was not willing to talk with his mother in the room.
Upon his mother leaving the room, we took time to play catch with a little ball as we discussed some of the things he likes to do with his mom and his dad.  Lucas had difficulty naming what he liked to do with his mom but identified an enjoyment of playing Hot Wheels with his dad. When invited to discuss how things had changed since his mom and dad were not living together, his immediate and clear comment was that he does not hear them yelling like they used to.  I asked Lucas what he used to do when he would hear his parents yelling, and he identified the fact that he would go to his room and shut the door and play with his toys.  When asked how he managed to avoid still hearing his mom and dad, he would say that he played very loudly with his toys and said things so that he would drown out the noise.  I complimented Lucas on what clever, smart strategies he has used to avoid hearing things that caused him to struggle.
Upon mom returning to the room, we engaged her in talking about some more of Lucas's strengths, and I asked them to enumerate what had happened the previous day that was so concerning.  Together they both did a very good job at this point talking and clarifying.  Lucas identified having taken off his shoes and throwing them against the wall and having gone to the bathroom and yelled at his mom.  Patient's mom was clear about having to continue to ask Lucas to follow directions and that he was resistant to doing so.  Both explained what had happened in a very calm manner as we played catch among the three of us to help lighten some of the intensity of the conversation. I took that moment to look at Lucas and say there are some kids that do really struggle with not being able to follow directions.  We discussed how some kids do things that cause them more problems when they are mad that get them into more trouble.  Lucas seemed very interested in that opportunity as was his mother.
I then shared a story story of a kid who used to hear his parents yelling a lot and realized that when both parents were yelling at each other, neither of them were listening. I alerted patient's mother that there was this little kid who also knew that he was not able to listen, and so when somebody is yelling, nobody is listening, and this little kid used to go up to his room and play really loud on the toys so he could drown out the awful noises he heard.  I did not directly tell mother what Lucas had said but gave her a wink as if to alert her.  It appeared that they were softer with each other from that point on during the visit as we strategized things they might be able to do to get along better at home and provide Lucas with alternative options for dealing with being mad.
