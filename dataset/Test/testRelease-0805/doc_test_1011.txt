Family history information was obtained from the patient and her partner this morning.  Details from the family histories are on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.  Pertinent information is as follows:
Ms. Benjamin has one sister, age 32, and two brothers, ages 34 and 17, who are all reportedly healthy.  One of her brothers has a son diagnosed with Dubowitz syndrome.  Her parents, ages 53 and 50, are alive and well.
Ms. Benjamin does report that her father's brother's daughter's daughter (a first-cousin-once-removed) has features that are somewhat consistent with a diagnosis of Dubowitz syndrome; however, a confirmed diagnosis has not been made in this child.
Ms. Benjamin's partner has one brother, age 21, who is alive and well.  He has no nieces and nephews.
The remaining family history information for both Ms. Benjamin and her partner is essentially noncontributory to the risks for this pregnancy.
Ms. Benjamin reports that her family is of Norwegian and German ancestry.  Ms. Benjamin's partner reports that his family is of American Indian, Swedish, Norwegian, and Irish ancestry.  There is no known consanguinity between these families.
