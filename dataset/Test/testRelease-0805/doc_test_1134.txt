Ms. Lucas is a 52 year old female who lives with her 60 year old significant other in a shared home that is one level.  The gentleman was released from SMH last week after being diagnosed with a stroke.  Per patient, he has new left sided weakness, difficulty swallowing thin liquids and difficulty with speech.  She reports he is very mobile and able to safely move about the home.  His "memory and cognitive ability is just fine."  Due to this, he becomes "very frustrated and just downright angry."  He does not direct anger towards any individual and she is not fearful of patient or self safety.  At the time of dismissal, she believes physical therapy was recommended to continue but patient refused this option.  He has a follow up appointment with a physician tomorrow.  She plans to attend if he will give consent.  She would like to address the therapy and swallowing issues.  He has blood draws at Kinley Clinic.  A family friend is providing transportation to these appointments.  Ms. Lucas has contacted Dodge County Social Services (000-000-0000) for assistance to speech therapy appointment scheduled June 19, 2008.  Patient has South County medical assistance to the best of her knowledge.  I encouraged patient to determine if patient has a financial case worker.  If so, this individual may be able to assist with funding options and community resources.
We discussed coping of both patient and significant other.  She recently saw her primary care provider because "I was having an anxiety attack."  She has never experienced this before.  She reports feeling much better and well supported by doctor.  She attended a weekend class regarding strokes offered on 2 Do and "feels much better prepared to deal with this."  I provided education regarding support group at Maple Manor Nursing Home the first Tuesday of each month (1:30 - 2:30) provided by Elder Network.  She does not wish to attend as it would interfere with her work schedule.  In regards to his mental health, she believes "he is depressed but who wouldn't be."  He looks "very broken down.  He is only sleeping 3 hours a night (does not take naps).  If I leave it up to him, he wouldn't eat anything because he says he's not hungry now."  She denies he is suicidal.  Education regarding resources provided.  She plans to discuss with his physician tomorrow.
Plan:
1)  Education regarding Disability Linkage Line (000-000-0000) provided.  She will contact on own as needed.
2)  Education regarding EAP provided.  She will arrange visit should she feel this is needed in the future.
3)  Patient has refused need of support group.  I have contacted SEMCIL (000-0000) to research options for support of both patient and significant other.  Agency offers TBI services.  Number also given to Ms. Trana.
4)  Supportive counseling provided to assist with adjustment.  Coping techniques discussed.
