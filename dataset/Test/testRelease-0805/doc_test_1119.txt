The mother, age 38, is 138 cm.  She was evaluated for short stature at age 10 and had a bone age that was age 18.  She had a chromosome analysis which was normal, 46,XX.  She has had no bone densitometry studies done and no skeletal survey and has had no fractures.  No aches or pains related to her skeleton.  The maternal aunt, age 47, is 5' tall.  She has some learning disabilities and is otherwise completely well with no skeletal symptoms.  The solitary male maternal first cousin, age 9, is of normal height and healthy.
Siblings:  Brother, age 6, is 122 cm (5th percentile).  He has normal head circumference and normal development.  Brother died at age 0 days due to an in utero intracranial hemorrhage that occurred around 36 weeks' gestation.
