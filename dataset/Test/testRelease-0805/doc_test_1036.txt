Family history was collected from Mr. and Mrs. Johnson.  Details of the comprehensive family history are available in the Department of Medical Genetics.  Pertinent findings are as follows:  Mr. William's father, age 60, was reported to be in good health.  He has no history of a clotting disorder nor is there is any history in his extended family.  He is of Swedish ancestry.  Mr. William's mother, age 72, has a history of fibrocystic changes in the breasts.  Five or six years ago she fell, she believes due to the snow, however, retrospectively, family members wonder if she had a mild stroke.  Following that fall she had mobility problems, particularly in the upper trunk and neck, some dizziness, and some difficulty finding appropriate words.  She was well then for a number of years until about two months ago when she suffered a stroke.  As part of that workup, she had a negative cardiac evaluation but in hematology was found to have a factor V Leiden variant.  She is currently on Coumadin.  She also recently began having some back pain and sought evaluation.  This was ultimately found to be metastatic bone cancer from a presumed primary peritoneal cancer (she had a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy a number of years ago).  She is currently receiving palliative care.  She has four brothers and two sisters who are in their 68s and 58s.  None of these individuals have ever had a blood clot or problems with blood clots.  In addition, there are 12 nieces and nephews who also are reported to be in good health without a history of clotting disorder.
Mr. William's sister, age 42, is in good health.  She is a nonsmoker and used oral contraceptives for about 15 years.  She was found to be a factor V Leiden heterozygote.  She has not had a history of clots.  Her three children ranging in age from 24 to 19 are reported to be in good health.  They have not been tested for Factor V Leiden.  Mr. William's mother experienced two early second trimester miscarriages.  His second sister, about age 44, is reported to be in good health.  She used oral contraceptives for about ten years and recently started smoking.  She has never had a blood clot.  She is a factor V Leiden heterozygote.  She has four living children ranging in age from 22 to 11 who are reported to be in good health.  She also had four miscarriages, including one that occurred late second to third trimester at about six to seven months and three about which duration of pregnancy is unknown.
Children--a son died at age 32 in a motor vehicle accident.  He was in previous good health.  Daughter, age 23, is in good health.  She tested negative for the factor V Leiden variant.  Daughter, age 21, is in good health.  She tested positive for the factor V Leiden variant.  The couple experienced one miscarriage at three months' gestation, and daughter, age 2, is in good health.  She tested positive for the factor V Leiden variant.
Mr. William's wife Pam, age 49, is in good health.  Her family history was collected and is significant for her father having had a stroke at age 80.  The father also had a history of vascular surgery, a long history of smoking, and has had hip replacement.  Her mother also had a stroke and died at age 78 soon thereafter.  She had a one-year history of congestive heart failure.  There is no other history of bleeding or clotting disorders in Mrs. William's extended family.
