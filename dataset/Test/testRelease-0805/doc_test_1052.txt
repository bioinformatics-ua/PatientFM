Paternal family history is positive for Leo himself speculating he may have had ADHD that was never diagnosed or treated.  He was bright enough to learn enough fundamental knowledge (despite impaired concentration, rarely studying, or doing homework) to still graduate from high school and college.  Leo also acknowledged "a major loss of self-esteem" with the collapse of the real estate market resulting in "a 80-90% loss of income and investments" necessitating Noah's return to work; associated dysphoria with depressive symptoms and marital conflicts; and recently initiating a trial on Celexa titrated to 30 mg daily, in combination with weekly "counseling" that is "going okay," given the reality he has had only three sessions thus far.
Psychiatric problems among other paternal relatives include Leo's brother (Mike) being a brilliant computer technologist, who has been recruited to work for numerous major corporations and the Federal government, but who "has no social skills and can't get along with people."  Owen's son (Samuel's paternal cousin) has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome; and Leo's sister (Samuel's paternal aunt) has a history of being "exceedingly smart, but she always got poor grades."
Maternal family history is positive for Noah's grandmother and siblings being "constantly driven and energetic"; her grandfather being "anxious and couldn't sit still"; and a son of Noah's aunt having a diagnosis of ADHD.  Noah's mother died at age 72 from breast cancer after a life complicated by major depression, alcoholism, drug addiction (iatrogenically induced with chronic pain medication), and an attempted suicide.
There is no known family history of tic disorder among either maternal or paternal relatives, or other known psychiatric disorders on either side of the family.
