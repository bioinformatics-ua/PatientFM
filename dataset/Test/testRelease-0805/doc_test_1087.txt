Three generations of her family history were diagramed with her mother by Ms. Mary Kelly.  The original pedigree is on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.  Upon review and amplification, it is remarkable for the following:
William is the product of her mother's third or second pregnancy.  The previous pregnancy is identified as a miscarriage:  Her mother was tracking her temperature to assess the possibility of pregnancy and had a heavy vaginal bleed with clots (heavier than her usual period) approximately two weeks prior to the diagnosis of William's pregnancy.  This was associated with some cramping and back pain.  She felt that this was a miscarriage, although, this was not addressed medically.
I think that she may have miscarried a twin gestation.  Alternatively, this may have been a manifestation of abnormalities of her placenta, related to William's subsequent problems with lymphedema and pleural effusions.
The couple's first pregnancy resulted in a healthy boy, now 7-1/7 years of age, who is showing normal growth and development.  There was no history of similar problems during his pregnancy or perinatal period.
William's father is a healthy 20-year-old man with no history of birth defects, learning disabilities, who is of normal stature.
William's father's mother, a 49-year-old woman, takes seizure medicines.
William's mother, a 17-year-old woman, had menarche at age 20 and irregular periods as a teenager related to other medical problems, but, her cycle subsequently normalized on the pill, and she has had no difficulties conceiving.
William's mother's eldest sister has been diagnosed at Mayo with polycystic ovarian syndrome and, although, not obese, lost weight on medications.  She does have hirsutism.  She has had a successful pregnancy of a 6-6/2-year-old boy, who is said to have acid reflux and problems with growth.
William's mother suspects that her younger sister, age 19, who is overweight and hirsute, may also have polycystic ovary syndrome, although, she has not been evaluated for this to date.
In addition to these three pregnancies, William's mother's mother also experienced a molar pregnancy.
William's mother's mother is a 45-year-old woman with hypothyroidism and uterine fibroids.
Aside from this, there is no other family history of relevance and, in particular, none of other children with birth defects, problems with weight gain or growth, developmental delays, learning disabilities, or seizures.
William's parents are not blood relatives.
