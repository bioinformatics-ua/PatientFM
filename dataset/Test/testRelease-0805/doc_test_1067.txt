By mother's report, Axel's paternal cousin is a "pyromaniac," and two other cousins on Axel's side of the family are "drug abusers" and "negligent with child support."  However, she knows of no formal psychiatric disturbance among any of Benjamin's paternal relatives.
Maternal family history is positive for depression affecting mother's cousin.
Otherwise, there is no known history of psychiatric disturbance among either maternal or paternal relatives.
CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF KAITELYN
I introduced myself to Benjamin by explaining that I am a doctor who "helps children with worries" and that some children might be sad, others might be mad, and some might be frightened about things with their friends, their parents and family, other children at daycare and preschool, or a whole bunch of other circumstances in their life."  Benjamin began by saying that her "sadness" was "because my grandpa died 19 years ago," indicating it was "my dad's father" when I asked about which side of the family was involved (mother subsequently clarified that Benjamin was probably referring to maternal grandmother's death on September 11, 2004).  Benjamin then talked about "having a brother, Jacob, who is 15 years old and a sister, Jessica, age 6."  In truth, Benjamin is an only child, and mother speculates she was talking about two children from her previous daycare in Rochester.  Mother recounted that approximately two years ago Benjamin had an "imaginary friend" ("a boy named Shakee") who Benjamin initially said was "just pretend" but eventually came to assert was "real."  Benjamin also told me about "a sister and mother who died in a fire" and "a baby and father who died in a tornado" (which mother recalls has been a focus of Benjamin's concern during the past two to three weeks and perhaps stemmed from a television news broadcast about the tsunami and more recent events.
Since I sensed Benjamin as talking about "things that aren't real," I asked her "if anyone has told her not to talk about secrets or things that are real."  She denied that anyone has ever told her those kinds of things.  When I asked Benjamin about her dad, she responded, "my dad never lived together with us much or took me to the park."  However, she remembers "I rided my scooter in the house at Christmas because the wheels weren't muddy yet," and her association shifted to the mess of "two puppies to house train."  When I asked about her dad's current circumstances, Benjamin asserted "my dad lives at Owen's apartment, but they've knowed each other a long time."  She said spontaneously, "Owen's kind of nice and smooth, and my dad never gets angry."  She added, "my dad used to yell at me but not any more now that I'm older.  I always beat him at wrestling" (she then changed the subject abruptly to talk for a while about her coloring).
When I redirected the conversation to Benjamin's visits with father, she indicated having "her own bedroom and music at Owen's house" but added, "I can't turn it up too loud because Owen's sleeping."  Benjamin seemed not at all uncomfortable with her dad "having guns to hunt ducks and turkeys," adding spontaneously, "they cook them to eat, but they're too spicy for me."
I asked Benjamin if there had ever been a time when she felt she wished to not be alive at all.  She responded unhesitatingly that she "felt that way when my grandpa died," then added spontaneously, "but it's a secret that you only tell doctors."  She denied ever having any urge, plan, or intent on actual self-injury.
When I asked Benjamin what she would like if she had two magic wishes that would make her life better in any way that she would want, she responded:  (1) "I would want to change Julian (friend at preschool) from being mean to me" and (2) I would like for Nolan (neighborhood friend) to live closer to me."  Interestingly, Benjamin made no reference to either of her parents or to their current marital separation as something she would "wish to change."
