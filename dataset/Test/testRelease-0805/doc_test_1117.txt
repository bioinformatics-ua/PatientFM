A detailed family history was taken during the visit today.  The following are pertinent details from the collection of the complete family history on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.
Mrs. William's first pregnancy resulted in a full-term male (1997) who died at the age of 4 months.  While pregnant, Mrs. William had a triple serum screen which was positive.  This was followed with an amniocentesis which did not reveal any chromosome abnormalities.  The infant was born with multiple congenital abnormalities including the following: hydrocephalus (needed to be shunted eight times), shortened long bones, four cardiac malformations (including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), syndactyly of the toes and hands, and pyloric stenosis.  At birth, testing was performed for Smith-Lemli-Opitz and L1CAM; both of these tests were negative.  This infant died at the age of 0 months due to complications after cardiac surgery.  Mrs. William's second conception (2003) resulted in a spontaneous abortion at approximately 8 weeks gestation.  A D & C followed, and the karyotype was 47,XX,+20.  Mrs. William's third conception resulted in a spontaneous abortion at approximately 8 weeks gestation. A D & C followed; however, tissue did not grow to complete a chromosome analysis.
Mrs. William has a brother who died at the age of 46 reportedly due to myocardial infarction.  This individual suffered from schizophrenia and was reportedly macrocephalic.  He did not have any children.  Mrs. William has a 40-year-old sister who is currently suspected to have colorectal cancer.  She suffers from diabetes, ADHD, and dyslexia.  Mrs. William's sister has had three miscarriages and a son.  Her first conception resulted in a miscarriage, for which no reason was given.  Her second pregnancy resulted in a male who is currently healthy at the age of 2.  He reportedly is short-statured and macrocephalic.  His penis was initially "inside" and he was given testosterone to help its development; however, he is currently off testosterone.  This individual is not developmentally delayed.  Mrs. William's sister's third conception (2004) resulted in a miscarriage; karyotype revealed an extra chromosome 18.  Mrs. William's mother, age 66, reportedly has atrial fibrillation and mitral valve prolapse.  She has three brothers, one of whom is deceased to complications of diabetes.  He has five children who are currently healthy.  Mrs. William's two other maternal uncles are healthy and have healthy children.  Mrs. William's father died at the age of 71 due to cardiac complications.  He had a triple bypass surgery at the age of 55, and possibly had colon polyps.  Mrs. William's father has a half-sister who is currently healthy.
Mr. William is reportedly healthy at the age of 45.  He has syndactyly of the toes and is overweight.  He has a healthy 39-year-old sister who has three healthy children and has had one miscarriage, for which no reason was given.  Mr. William's mother, age 75, is overweight, has heart problems, and an elevated blood pressure level.  Mr. William's mother has a brother who died and a sister who is currently healthy.  Mr. William's father, age 73, was diagnosed with level 4 prostate cancer at the age of 51.  Mr. William's father has a brother who is currently healthy and has six healthy children.  Mr. William's paternal grandmother had a stillborn daughter, for which no reason was given.
There were no reports of mental retardation or learning disabilities.  There were no reports of cancer before the age of 44.
The remainder of the family history was non-contributory to today's discussion.
The patient reports English, Irish, German, Greek, French, and Native American (non-Jewish) heritage, and her husband is of Italian and German (non-Jewish) descent. There is no consanguinity reported between these families.
