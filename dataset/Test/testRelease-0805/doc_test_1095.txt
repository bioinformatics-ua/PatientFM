Four generations of her family history were diagramed with her parents by Ms. Mary Kelly.  The original pedigree is on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.  Upon review and amplification, it is remarkable only for the following.
Liam is the oldest of two sisters.  Her 3-year-old sister is showing normal behavioral growth and development and has only age-appropriate tantrums.
Liam's mother is a 34-year-old physician who is adopted and has no information about her biological family.  In her 18s, she was recognized as having what appears to be benign anisocoria.  She has also had periodic problems with pericarditis, pleuritis, and arthritis and has been found to have low titers of anti-RNP.  She finds that treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs is sufficient to control these symptoms.
Liam's father is a 43-year-old electrical engineer who has no history of neurodevelopmental problems, seizures, or movement disorder.  He has been diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder and occasionally has some tremor after drinking excessive amounts of caffeine.
Liam's father's brother, a 37-year-old gentleman, is considered by the family to possibly have bipolar disease but has not been formally diagnosed.  He also has a history of dyslexia.
Liam's father's 44-year-old sister is described as overweight with depression and chronic headache as is a 41-year-old brother is also described as overweight.
One of Liam's father's sister's daughters died shortly after birth and was premature.  That child's sibling had acute myelocytic leukemia.
Liam's father's mother developed intermittent atrial fibrillation and has been treated with Coumadin since her 20s; she is now 64.  That lady's sister is reported to have genetic hemochromatosis.  Liam's father's father, a 70-year-old gentleman, has a pacemaker for supraventricular tachycardia of very late adult onset.  Liam's father's father's mother's sister is said to have Huntington disease.
Aside from this, there is no other family history of relevance and in particular none of persons diagnosed with manic depressive disorder, chronic myopathies, inborn errors of metabolism, or primary or secondary carnitine deficiency.
Liam's parents are not blood relatives.
