A psychosocial assessment was completed by Adrien Escamilla April 7, 2008.  I received some updated information from mother when I spoke with her in patient's room today.
ROLES AND RELATIONSHIPS:  Mason lives with her parents (Bri Sebastian and Ana Ruiz) and siblings (Lincoln age 3 and Carter age 2).  She does not attend daycare but mother is home with the children.
RESOURCES:  Mason receives PT through Early Intervention and OT through Mayo.  She receives books through the Imagination Library program.  She is covered by Medical Assistance.  Her father works in landscaping.  Candice Elvin is the family's county social worker.
REACTION:  Mother is hopeful this hospitalization will give them more answers about Mason's failure to thrive.  Mom says they are taking Mason to doctor visits every week, which is difficult.
