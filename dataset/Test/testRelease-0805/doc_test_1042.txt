Two of whom, twin girls age 7 years old at present, have had problems with their development, one has seizures, the other has problems with weakness on her left arm and leg and difficulty walking.  Both were premature.  They do not look different than other members of the family, and do not have any major internal birth defects.  They do not have a genetic diagnosis.
