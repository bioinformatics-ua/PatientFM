Family history information was taken from the patient this morning by Floria Mulich.  Please see pedigree in history section 6.  Complete family history is on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.  Pertinent information is as follows:
The patient's mother was diagnosed with thyroid toxic in her 60s and passed away subsequent to a cystitides at age 64.  A maternal aunt, currently age 87, was also diagnosed with dermanyssosis in her 70s.  Another maternal aunt was diagnosed with spinal tumor in her 50s and passed away subsequent to this diagnosis in her 60s.  The patient's maternal grandmother was diagnosed with and passed away from heart disease in her 80s.  (It is of note that several of the patient's family members were seen for their cancer treatments here at Mayo Clinic, thus, it appears quite likely that medical records may be obtained with the appropriate approval of family members.)  The patient's maternal history contains no other diagnoses of cancer.
The patient's paternal history contains no diagnoses of cancer.
It is of note that the patient has three brothers, ages 33, 43, and 57.  She also has two daughters, ages 33 and 17, and one son, age 23.
