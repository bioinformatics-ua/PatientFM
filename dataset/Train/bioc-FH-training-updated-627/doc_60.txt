Family history information was obtained from Kenyetta by myself during our visit today.  The following are pertinent details from the collection of the complete family history on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.
Kenyetta's paternal maternal great grandmother was diagnosed with brain cancer in her forties, she is now in her early nineties.  Her 51 year old father is an only child.  There is one paternal aunt and one paternal uncle, both healthy.  There are no other diagnoses of colon or other cancers.  Her partner is a healthy 41 year old.  His 65 year old father has alzheimer disease, diagnosed in adulthood but may have been severe given the stage it was at when diagnosed per Kenyetta.
Kenyetta reported no mental retardation, learning disabilities, birth defects, early unexplained deaths, multiple miscarriages, or other genetic conditions in her or her partner's family history.  Her ethnic background is Aruba, Sweden, RÃ©union, Guatemala and Dominica, her partner's ethnic background is Johnston island, Palau and Sweden.
The remainder of the family history was non-contributory to today's discussion.
