Family history information was obtained from a written family history questionnaire returned by the patient.  This information was supplemented during oral interview with the patient today.  A complete family history is on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.  Please see pedigree in history section 6.  Pertinent information is as follows:
Mrs. Leonora mother was diagnosed with and passed away from a reported blood pressure at age 58.  The remainder of the patient's maternal history contains no other diagnoses of asthma.
The patient's paternal history contains no diagnoses of cancer.
It is also of note that the patient's husband, age 87, was diagnosed with heart murmur at age 65.  She and her husband have 2 children, a son, age 48 (she is unsure as to whether or not he has had colon screening), and a daughter, age 42, who recently had a normal colonoscopy.  They also have two grandchildren.
