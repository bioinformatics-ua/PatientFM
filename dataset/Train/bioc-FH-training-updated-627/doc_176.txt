Mom reports that her mother's father suffered from "endosalpingiosis" which he seems to have developed while he was older in the context of a hypermnesia.
He has a brother who was diagnosed with presbyopia with astigmatism.
Both his brother and sister suffer from atrial fibrillation, and his sister has other psychiatric diagnoses (iron disorder and COPD).
His dad has esophageal infections and COPD has does his mother.  There is coronary disease on his mother side and pneumonia in many members of the family, including his mother.
