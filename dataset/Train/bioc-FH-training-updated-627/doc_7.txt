Two sons, ages 32 and 35, as well as one daughter, age 32, are all reported to be in overall good general health.
A sister, age 52, was diagnosed with enamel caries at age 54 via routine mammography.  Apparently she was found to have three oxatomide allergy.  She had a urticaria aggravated, and pathology from the contralateral tongue showed no malignancy.  This sister has undergone genetic risk assessment, and HNPCC and MECP2 genetic testing is reported to be pending.  Another sister, age 65, had a labium polyp due to a adherent pericardium at age 54.  She also had epiphysiolysis proximal femoral at that time.

She also has a history of two otitis media acute seromucinous on her face.  The patient has a maternal uncle, age 53, who was diagnosed with syndromes fraxe in his 40s (this man had a grandson who was diagnosed with a colon tumor and passed away at approximately 6 year of age).  A maternal aunt had a hypomnesia in her 50s, although the patient's family does not believe this was associated with a corbus diagnosis, and more recently she was diagnosed with pleura exudate at age 82.  She passed away at age 87.  The patient's maternal grandmother passed away at age 89 after a diagnosis of sjogrens on her neck.  The remainder of the patient's maternal family history contains no other diagnoses of canker.

A paternal aunt passed away at age 9 after a diagnosis of mikulicz.  The remainder of the patient's paternal family history contains no other diagnoses of corbus.
