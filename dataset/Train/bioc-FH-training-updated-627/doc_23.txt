Obtained with the assistance of genetic counselor Cristina Oriola and reviewed as follows.
The paternal grandfather is 92 and has some gangliosidosis. The paternal grandmother died in her 60s with a phycomycosis that first began in her 60s. They are Latvia, Israel Bulgaria, and Nepal.  The father, age 56, has had pachygyria treated. He has some seasonal hemophilia and has required one hospitalization for this. He currently is doing well. There are four paternal aunts and uncles. Several have had surface dyslexia requiring treatment. There are three paternal first cousins, ages 34 through 44, who are all living and well. One cousin has a leptomeningeal metastases child who had a conjunctivitis-like problem at birth. This is a male child. No underlying diagnosis is known. I encouraged Ms. Lawana to ask her cousin if there was an underlying diagnosis. This is a fourth degree relative to her.
The maternal grandfather died of a foot ulcer and had meningitis recurrent diagnosed. The maternal grandmother died in her 80s of unknown cause. They were Benin and Lesotho. The mother, age 52, does not have the papillary carcinoma, so this is not relevant for Ms. Lawana. There are two maternal aunts in their 60s. One had pineoblastoma in her late 30s. One maternal uncle, age 57, is healthy. There are two maternal first cousins in their 40s to 50 who are healthy and they have twelve children who are all healthy.
A sister, age 27, is healthy. Ms. Lawana had a twin that was hemophilia due to an paranasal sinus cancer.
