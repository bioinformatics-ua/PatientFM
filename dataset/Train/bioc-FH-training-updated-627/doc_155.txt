A detailed family history was taken during the visit today.  The following are pertinent details from the collection of the complete family history on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.
This is Cira Antn’s second pregnancy, both of which were with her current partner.  Her first pregnancy was electively terminated at approximately 20 weeks gestation.  Cira Antn has a 20-year-old brother who was found to be a carrier for keratoacanthoma but is otherwise healthy and has no children.  Cira Antn has a 21-year-old brother who was diagnosed with steroid purpura at birth; she is unsure whether he has had any genetic testing performed.  His partner has not been able to conceive. He has klinefelter that is presumed to be due to his diagnosis.  Cira Antn’s mother suffers from pneumothorax iatrogenic but is otherwise healthy at the age of 43.  Her father is healthy at the age of 43.
Cira Antn’s partner, Mr. Vera Merryman, is healthy at the age of 34.  He has a healthy 1-year-old son and a healthy 2-year-old daughter from a prior relationship.  He has a healthy 44-year-old sister who has no children.  He also has a healthy 45-year-old sister who has a healthy daughter.  His father is healthy at the age of 55, and his mother was diagnosed with skin cancer in her 40s and is currently 51.  Part of her skin was excised and this diagnosis was thought to be due to excessive sunshin.
There were no reports of cornea hypesthesia, traction diverticulum, or lyme carditis.  No family members had multiple miscarriages or babies that were still born or died early.  There were no reports of cancer before the age of 40.  The remainder of the family history was non-contributory to today's discussion.
The patient reports Latvia and Macedonia (non-Sweden) heritage, and her partner is of Taiwan and Indonesia (non-Latvia) descent. There is no consanguinity reported between these families.
