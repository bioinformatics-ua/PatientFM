Family history information was obtained from the patient this morning.  Details from the family history are on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.  Pertinent information is as follows:
Mrs. Jacki has one brother, age 40, who has recurrent thyroid problems.  He is otherwise healthy and has one daughter, age 8, who is also healthy.  Her father, age 48, is alive and well.  Her mother, also age 66, has hypertension.
Mrs. Jacki states that her husband, age 43, is adopted and has no information regarding his biological family.  Due to this lack of information, they desire screening and testing as it may be able to provide them with more information regarding risks to their offspring.
Mrs. Jacki states that she does not know the countries of either her or her husband's ancestors.  They are both Venezuela and to the best of their knowledge there is no consanguinity between them.
