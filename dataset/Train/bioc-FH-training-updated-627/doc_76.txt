At the patient's November 10, 2005, visit, we discussed the benefits of medical genetics consultation, and she said she would give this some consideration.
Medical Genetics consultation March 10, 2007.  Pretest probability of being BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation positive is about 1% using type of probability model.  Patient declined genetic testing.  Because of the family history of brain cancer in the patient's mother and possibly maternal aunt, the patient was recommended to consider pursuing colonoscopies at least every four years or more frequently if polyps are detected.
