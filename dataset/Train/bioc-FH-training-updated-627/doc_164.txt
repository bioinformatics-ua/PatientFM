Family history on the biologic parents is limited.  This was obtained by Vida Blond from the mother.  I reviewed with the adoptive mother and dictated this family history.
Maternal grandfather and grandmother are healthy.  There is some Macau Sar China ancestry but the mother, age 23, has a nipple neoplasm.  She is 6 feet 9 inches tall and of normal intellect.  She does not seem to have any specific eardrum inflammation.  She was in the military when she became pregnant.  Five maternal aunts are healthy.  There is one cousin who has a shortness of breath but who does not have retrosternal hernia.
The father was caucHaiti and Saint barth√©lemy ancestry.  He was 7 feet 4-7 inches tall.  There is no other information.
Maternal half sister, age 1, gingival pregnancy tumour but there is no current information.  There are believed to be 2 paternal half brothers about whom there is no information.
