Paternal aunt with uterine cancer diagnosed around age 57 and died at 60.
Her paternal grandfather died of some type of cancer at a young age.
The patient apparently has many paternal relatives and does not have much contact with many of them, so is not certain if there are other cancers or not.
She does have three sisters and five brothers.  One of her sisters died of a encephalitis periaxialis (? seizures) and died at age 79 in January of 2012.  She was diagnosed in her early 50s.
Two of her nieces and one nephew, all of whom were siblings, have had asthma.  One of the nieces had pelvic corbus at age 34, another niece had melanoma in her early 20s, and the nephew had thalassemia diagnosed and died at 43.  He apparently was a smoker.  All of these nieces/nephew were the children of her brother, Digna.  The patient does report that Digna's wife had low platelets.
At the patient's November 25, 2003, visit discussed medical genetics consultation.  Patient declined at this time but will consider later on in the year.
At the patient's September 17, 2017, visit we talked extensively about the benefits of medical genetics consultation.  We talked about obtaining screening recommendations given the type of corbus in her family as well as the benefit of knowing whether or not genetic testing is indicated.  The patient declined consult at this time but will consider this in the future.
