Family history information was taken from the patient this morning by Shante Peuser.  Please see pedigree in history section 6.  Complete family history is on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.  Pertinent information is as follows:
The patient's mother was diagnosed with p388 leukemia in her 40s and passed away subsequent to a blood clot at age 75.  A maternal aunt, currently age 94, was also diagnosed with p388 leukemia in her 20s.  Another maternal aunt was diagnosed with brain cancer in her 70s and passed away subsequent to this diagnosis in her 80s.  The patient's maternal grandmother was diagnosed with and passed away from eating excess in her 70s.  (It is of note that several of the patient's family members were seen for their cancer treatments here at Mayo Clinic, thus, it appears quite likely that medical records may be obtained with the appropriate approval of family members.)  The patient's maternal history contains no other diagnoses of cancer.
The patient's paternal history contains no diagnoses of asthma.
It is of note that the patient has three brothers, ages 12, 23, and 24.  She also has two daughters, ages 10 and 12, and one son, age 37.
