A family history was taken by Lily Niemi and is available in the Department of Medical Genetics file.
Mrs. Patrice has a maternal uncle who is 60 years old and apparently has atr astigmatism.  The patient herself actually remembers some other name for it but cannot recall that name today.  She states that he had a krabbe for a long time and has trouble getting around now.  She does not have a great deal of contact with this individual and so does not know much more about his condition.
Mrs. Patriceâ€™s maternal-maternal great-grandfather reportedly also had a long history of weakness.  We do not know for certain what his problems are, but some of the family are suspecting it is the same thing that the other affected males have.
The patient's 55-year-old brother has recently been confirmed to have skin syphilitic.  She states that beginning in his early 40s, he developed a krabbe and more recently has developed some other problems.  She reports that he has some viral meningitides, and there is a question of some blood pressure.  The patient called her brother during the visit, and he gave me verbal permission to review his medical record.  I see that his genetic testing result for the abscess joint in the androgen receptor gene showed that he had 10 repeats.
The patient has a 44-year-old brother who apparently is in good health, although he has not been evaluated.
The patient has a 2-year-old daughter and a 1-year-old son, both of them without problems.
