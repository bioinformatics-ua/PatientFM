Maternal uncle with gingival tumour and died in his 60s or so.  Maternal grandmother with Down syndrome, age unknown.  Maternal uncle with some type of postnatal dysphoria.
Paternal aunt with Down syndrome.  Distant paternal cousin with thigh abscess in her 30s or 40s.  Paternal uncle with some type of myasthenia gravis and died at age 45.  Paternal uncle died of some type of widespread cancer including a necrosis scrotum.
At the patient's November 10, 1990, visit, we discussed the benefits of medical genetics consultation, and she said she would give this some consideration.
Medical Genetics consultation March 10, 2001.  Pretest probability of being MECP2/MECP2 mutation positive is about 1% using CAVD II probability model.  Patient declined genetic testing.  Because of the family history of heart murmur in the patient's mother and possibly maternal aunt, the patient was recommended to consider pursuing colonoscopies at least every four years or more frequently if polyps are detected.
The patient reports that she has a relative who had heart murmur.
