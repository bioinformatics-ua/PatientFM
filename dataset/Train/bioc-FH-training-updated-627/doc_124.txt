Family history information was obtained from Mrs. Shelba and her husband this morning.  Details from the family history are on file in the Department of Medical Genetics.  Pertinent information is as follows:
Mrs. Shelba has one brother, age 40, and one nephew, 9 year old, who are both in good general health.  Her father and mother, ages 55 and 45, are also healthy.
Mr. Shelba, age 35, is healthy.  He has one brother, age 45, and one nephew, age 2, who are also healthy.  His father, age 53, is alive and well.  His mother, age 47, has a personal history of congestive heart failure; however, she has been in remission for quite some time.
The remaining family history for both Mrs. Shelba and her husband is essentially noncontributory to the risks of this pregnancy.  There is no family history of mental retardation, learning disabilities, birth defects, multiple pregnancy loss, stillbirths, infant deaths, or cystic fibrosis (diagnosis or symptomatology) in their families.
Mrs. Shelba reports that her family is of Norway, Gambia, and Albania ancestry.  Mr. Shelba reports that his family is of Norway, Sri lanka, and Belgium ancestry.  There is no known consanguinity between these families.
